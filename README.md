# String_Reversal

<p>This project is  intended to demonstrate different methods for and approaches to reversing an input string.</p>
<br/>
<p>Six different methods are included in the program: a for loop function, a funciton utlizing the "reverse" funciton in C++'s std algorithm header, a function utilizing char*, a recursive function, a function utilizing a stack, and a function utilizing the "transform" function in C++'s std algorithm header.</p>
<p>Strings may also be passed to the program from the command line as a parameter</p>
